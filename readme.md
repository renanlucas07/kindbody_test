code_review:
First of all i tried to understand what the class did, and what i understood is that it was for returning a list of clinics that are located inside a given radius around a given zipcode.

then i thought of a way to run the code, to make my testing easier, this is not part of the code review it was just to run the code, so i required all gems that were being used and add others to help me debug, i created an account at zipcodeapi.com, and stored the api key in an environment variable. than i mocked the return of query of Partner Clinics, in the extracted_zip_codes_from_db, i created a file clinics.yml that contained an array of hashes with a zipcode and a tier, and i ordered the array by tier, in the method i loaded the yaml file, and created an array of objects with the fields that would be returned from the query, using the map method to return the array and the OpenStruct class to create objects out of hashes, so the mock would be compatible with the rest of the code, irunned the code with irb and confirmed that it worked

then i've started looking for lint errors with rubocop, and it found a couple of small things.

First i renamed the class to something that made more sense, then i removed the second line that made the class inherit itself, so every public method would be a class method, and i turned it into a service, that you can instantiate, i added a constructor and attribute readers so the instance variables wouldn't need to be passed as parameters to every method

i changed every method, that returned something, to store the return value into an instance variable, that could be accessible by any method, after said method is called

then i looked to every method following the flow of the code

the method call_zip_codes_api i only removed the parameters, and added the instance variable to store the return of the method

then the extract_zip_codes_from_api method, i thought that the logic of getting the reponse from the api and converting it into a hash containing an array of zipcodes and a hash with each zipcode as the key and the distance from the given zipcode as the value was smart, so i didn't changed the logic, but i refactored it to be more efficient, now the zipcodes array is created with a map, i had to use a lambda function inside map because the zip_data['zip_codes'] variable is an array of hashes, and i couldn't pass a string to the short syntax of map

had a array of literals, that represent, so i shortened it with the %w (percent w) expression, and since i don't have the list of zipcodes being passed as a parameter anymore, so i created a variable to get

the formatted_response method had too many lines, i tried to shortten it that's why i removed the response variable and changed the each for a map, beacause map already returns an array, it still has more lines than what rubocop would like.
